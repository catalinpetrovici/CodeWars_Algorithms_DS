// The Feast of Many Beasts

// All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name. For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.

// Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.

// Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.

function feast(beast, dish) {
  return beast[0] === dish[0] &&
    beast[beast.length - 1] === dish[dish.length - 1]
    ? true
    : false;
}

// Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, ()
// In other words , try every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained
// Consider an Example :
// With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3 , here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

// 1 * (2 + 3) = 5
// 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
// 1 + 2 * 3 = 7
// (1 + 2) * 3 = 9
// So the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.

// Notes
// The numbers are always positive.
// The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10).
// You can use the same operation more than once.
// It's not necessary to place all the signs and brackets.
// Repetition in numbers may occur .
// You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.

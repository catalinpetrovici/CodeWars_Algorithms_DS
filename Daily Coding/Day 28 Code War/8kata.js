// Correct the mistakes of the character recognition software

// Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

// When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

// Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

// S is misinterpreted as 5
// O is misinterpreted as 0
// I is misinterpreted as 1
// The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

function correct(string) {
  const digitizedCharacter = {
    5: 'S',
    0: 'O',
    1: 'I',
  };

  return string
    .split('')
    .map((char) => (digitizedCharacter[char] ? digitizedCharacter[char] : char))
    .join('');
}

console.log(correct('L0ND0N'));

// Thinkful - Logic Drills: Traffic light

// You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights. You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

// Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

// For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

function updateLight(current) {
  if (current === 'green') return 'yellow';
  if (current === 'yellow') return 'red';
  if (current === 'red') return 'green';
}

// Sum The Strings

// Create a function that takes 2 integers in form of a string as an input, and outputs the sum (also as a string):

// Example: (Input1, Input2 -->Output)

// "4",  "5" --> "9"
// "34", "5" --> "39"
// "", "" --> "0"
// "2", "" --> "2"
// "-5", "3" --> "-2"
// Notes:

// If either input is an empty string, consider it as zero.

// Inputs and the expected output will never exceed the signed 32-bit integer limit (2^31 - 1)

function sumStr(a, b) {
  return (+a + +b).toString();
}

console.log(sumStr('4', '5'));
